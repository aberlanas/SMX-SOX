# A High-Flying problem!


Hi little pilots!

All the plains require a minimum speed (usually in knots), for make the *takeoff*. This speeds (also called **VR** in Spanish (for *Velocidad de Rotaci√≥n*)), is the speed that allows the plane to begining to takeoff from the runway. 

It is not exactly the same (Obviouly) in all the planes, but for the most famous comercial models, it rounds the 300km/h.
